# Project-Template
This is a sample of what we expect all FEs to work with, we won't approve if the criteria is not met

## Guidelines
- This is a template repository, so you just have to click use this template to get started
- Use 90% Bootstrap
- Style Custom CLASSES, not Elements or BOOTSTRAP classes
- Use of inline styles is highly discouraged, all styking should be in the css file.
- Use a Mobile-first approach (Your CSS should be for mobile-first before Tab and Desktop)
- DRY - Do not repeat yourself
- Use 4 media query breakpoints (recommended breakpoints are min-width of 576px, 768px, 992px, 1200px)
- Your pages must be RESPONSIVE!
- Your custom CSS classes have to be prefixed with the section you are working on. E.g for your header, instead of having a button class of btn, you can have btn-header or header-btn.
- COMMENTS are very important, Please comment all sections
- Your sections should be wrapped in .container where necessary

## Testing
- You would need to set up your repository with netlify and submit the live link and github repository link for approval
